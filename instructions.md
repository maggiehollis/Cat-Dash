# Instructions

## Goal of the game

The goal of the game is simple. To go for as long as you can and get to the highest level possible.

## How you lose

Since you - the player – are a cat, you have nine lives. Once you run into the obstacles – the boxes – nine times, the game stops running and you lose. 

## How to move

There are three ways to move. You can move left and right using the left and right arrow keys. You can also jump using the up array. Be careful not to hit your tail against something, that counts as hitting the obstacle!

## Progression

As you run further and further the game speeds up. Every time the game speeds up your level increases as well.

## Other Notes

I exclusively ran this in Chrome. Sometimes when you hit run it goes really fast or really slow. I attributed this to replit and the browser being a but glitchy. If you find that when you run it, it moves at a super fast or glitchy pace, just re run it and it should work! 

Also if you try to run the code in a new tab, you may get an error that the url is not safe. I do not know how to fix this. 

If you find that the keyboard controls are not working, simply click on the game screen and then try again.
